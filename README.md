Jackpot Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69367210?s=400&u=7cde2335fcbc3dd2bd0eb5e2e6bbb74c34252d26&v=4)](https://github.com/777-Project/777)

777 Jackpot was taken over by us, the [Sapphire Team](https://sappcoin.com/), on August 12, 2020 and reactivated by a fork after the previous developer had disappeared.
777 is the Ticker and the name of the coin from 777 Jackpot
In contrast to many other masternodes, our focus is on real business cases.
Since Crex24 was not willing to relist 777, the coin will be listed on our own exchange: [Heliobank](https://heliobank.net/)
In the beginning, there will surely be one or the other problem, so we ask for a little patience until everything runs smoothly.
