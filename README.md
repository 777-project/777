Jackpot Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/69367210?s=400&u=7cde2335fcbc3dd2bd0eb5e2e6bbb74c34252d26&v=4)](https://github.com/777-Project/777)

777 Jackpot was taken over by DECENOMY, the [Sapphire](https://sappcoin.com/) Team, on August 12, 2020 and reactivated by a fork after the previous developer had disappeared.

777 is the Ticker and the name of the coin from 777 Jackpot.
In contrast to many other masternodes, our focus is on real business cases.
The coin will be listed on our own exchange: [Heliobank](https://heliobank.net/)

On February 1, 2021 777 has merged together with FunctionCoin (FUNC), this merge was performed to create a stronger team to bring us to the next level. Since the 2 projects had some alignments in terms of community and investors the choice was easy to make.
Another advantage was that we gained 2 additional exchanges, Crex24 and Midas.

In the beginning, there will surely be one or the other problem, so we ask for a little patience until everything runs smoothly.
